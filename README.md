# Movies-ETL

This challenge involved using the "extract, transform, load" process to transform multiple sets of data to create a user-friendly, clean database of movie and ratings information. The three datasets included: 1) a list of movies and various information taken from Wikipedia; 2) a list of movies with similar, though not identical, data taken from Kaggle; and 3) a dataset of ratings corresponding to these lists of movies. The first two datasets were combined after an iterative process of cleaning, organizing, and combining data columns, and the third ratings dataset was added to the merged product of the first two after grouping ratings by movie and score given. The cleaning and organizing took place using Python and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook, and the resulting tables were transferred to SQL using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4.
